# 20-20-20 Rule Desktop Reminder Application

## 🖥️ About
Create a desktop reminder app using Python Tkinter that prompts users to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes. The program can discreetly sit in the taskbar and alert users with a pop-up window and reminder sound when it's time to rest their eyes.

## 👀 20-20-20 Rule Reminder

Prevent digital eye strain with the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break from your screen. Focus on an object 20 feet away to relax your eyes.

## 📦 Modules
Three key modules have been used in developing this application: tkinter, time, and pygame. 

### 💡 tkinter:
Purpose: tkinter serves as the graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, enabling the creation of windows, buttons, and other interactive elements.
Application: With tkinter, I have designed an intuitive user interface that displays the countdown timer, alerts, and interactive controls to enhance user engagement.

### ⏰ time:
Purpose: The time module provides essential time-related functions, allowing precise control over time intervals and scheduling.
Application: Leveraging time, I have implemented the logic to track the passage of time, precisely triggering reminders every 20 minutes and managing the 20-second breaks effectively.

### 🎵 pygame:
Purpose: pygame is a versatile library commonly used for multimedia applications, including sound playback.
Application: With pygame, I have integrated sound alerts into the application, ensuring that users are gently reminded to take breaks by creating pleasant auditory cues at the designated intervals.
